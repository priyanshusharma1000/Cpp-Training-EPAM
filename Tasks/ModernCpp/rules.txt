Rule of Three, Rule of Five, and Rule of Zero in C++


1)Rule of Three :-

Introduction

The Rule of Three in C++ states that if a class manages resources (like dynamic memory), it should explicitly define three special member functions to ensure proper resource management.


The Three Special Member Functions
Destructor (~ClassName()) - Cleans up resources.

Copy Constructor (ClassName(const ClassName& other)) - Creates a deep copy.

Copy Assignment Operator (operator=(const ClassName& other)) - Assigns a deep copy.

Why is the Rule of Three Important?

Prevents memory leaks and dangling pointers.

Ensures proper copying behavior for dynamically allocated resources.

Avoids double deletion issues in destructors.

2)Rule of Five :-
Introduction

The Rule of Five extends the Rule of Three in C++ by adding move semantics introduced in C++11. It ensures efficient resource management and prevents unnecessary deep copies.


The Five Special Member Functions
Destructor (~ClassName()) - Cleans up resources.

Copy Constructor (ClassName(const ClassName& other)) - Creates a deep copy.

Copy Assignment Operator (operator=(const ClassName& other)) - Assigns a deep copy.

Move Constructor (ClassName(ClassName&& other) noexcept) - Transfers ownership of resources.

Move Assignment Operator (operator=(ClassName&& other) noexcept) - Transfers ownership in assignment.

Why is the Rule of Five Important?

Prevents memory leaks and dangling pointers.


Ensures efficient resource management.


Enables move semantics for better performance.


Avoids unnecessary deep copies, improving speed.

When to Use the Rule of Five?
When a class manages dynamic memory.

When implementing resource-managing classes (e.g., file handles, sockets, smart pointers).

When dealing with large objects where moving is preferable to copying.

1)Rule of Zero :-

Introduction

The Rule of Zero is a modern C++ design principle that states that user-defined special member functions (destructor, copy/move constructors, and copy/move assignment operators) should be avoided by leveraging RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) and standard library containers like std::unique_ptr and std::shared_ptr for resource management.


Why Use the Rule of Zero?
Reduces boilerplate code and manual resource management.

Avoids memory leaks and dangling pointers.

Increases exception safety.

Takes advantage of modern C++ features (smart pointers, containers, etc.).

When to Use the Rule of Zero?

When using RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization).

When working with standard library containers (e.g., std::vector, std::string, std::shared_ptr).

When writing modern, maintainable C++ code that avoids manual memory management.
