Day 1
Session 1: Santhosh Malay
Covered essential concepts of C programming, including:
Structures, unions, and structure padding.
Pointers and pointer arithmetic.
Dynamic memory allocation (malloc, calloc, realloc, free).


Session 2: Seetharam Maddineni
ðŸš€ Official Start of C++ Training!
Fundamentals of C++ programming and class structure.
Explanation of:
Different types of constructors.
Operator overloading (especially the assignment operator).
Destructors and their role in memory management.


Day 2 - Day 4
Session by: Santhosh Malay
Deep dive into C++ classes and default member functions.
Covered:
Constructor types and overloading.
Destructor behavior with pointer-based resources.
Execution of constructors in an array of objects.
Assigned task: Create an array of objects and analyze constructor execution.


Day 5
Session by: Narendra Kodi
Discussion on tricky and interesting C programming questions.
Topics covered:
Various format specifiers (%o, %x, %X, %e, %E, %g, %f, %10.2s, %-15d).
Task 1: Find the length of a string in C without using loops, then implement it using recursion.
Task 2: Develop a program to add two large numbers exceeding 2^32 - 1 (for 32-bit) and 2^64 -1 (for 64-bit architectures).
Task 3: Implement custom functions in C with functionalities similar to strcpy, strtok, and strstr.
