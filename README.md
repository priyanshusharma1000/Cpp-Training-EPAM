Day 1
Session by: Seetharam Maddineni,
The session started with a fundamental introduction to data types in C and C++. It also provided an in-depth understanding of the extern and static keywords. Seetharam assigned us a hands-on taskâ€”to perform all possible operations on strings, which can be found in this folder!


Day 2
Session 1 by: Santhosh Malay,
This session was focused on clearing doubts regarding the training. Santhosh also shared some important credentials with us and gave insights into the training program.


Session 2 by: Lalit Manchwari,
Lalit introduced us to the structure of C programming and presented some interesting yet tricky questions on printf and scanf, making the session both challenging and engaging!


Day 3 & Day 4
Session by: Seetharam Maddineni,
These sessions covered the concepts of strings in depth. Along with resolving doubts, Seetharam introduced the concept of operators and explained the significance of bitwise operators in C++ development.


Day 5 & Day 6
Session by: Lalit Manchwari,
Lalit dived into the concept of recursion, providing an in-depth analysis of inline functions. Additionally, we explored file handling in C, covering it extensively through practical implementations.

Day 1
Session 1 by: Santhosh Malay
Santhosh covered essential concepts of C programming, including structures, unions, structure padding, pointers, and pointer arithmetic. We also delved into dynamic memory allocation using malloc, calloc, realloc, and free, understanding their real-world applications.


Session 2 by: Seetharam Maddineni
ðŸš€ OFFICIAL START OF C++ TRAINING!
Seetharam introduced us to the fundamentals of C++ programming, including its structure and the concept of classes. We explored different types of constructors, operator overloading (especially the assignment operator), and the role of destructors in memory management.

Day 2&3&4:
session taken by santhosh malay which includes the concept of classes of c++ and their default member functions and diff types of constructor and then delve into constructor overloading and then discussion on destructor and how the workflow going on in case of pointer resources of class and the array of objects and then he insist us to make array of objects and check the execution of constructor.



Day 5:
session taken by: Narendra Kodi
Session consist of tricky and intresting question about c programming i.e different format specifiers for ex %o,%x %X,%e %E,%g %f,%10.2s,%-15d
then some of the task given by him to find the length of the string in c without using loop and he then told to do this using recursion and one more task given by him is to create a program that is capable off adding two large number whose end result go beyong 2^32 - 1 in a 32 bit architecture and 2^64 -1 in a 64 bit architecture.and create our own function in c that has capability to perform the task as of strcpy,strtok,strstr

Day1: 
session taken by Lalit Manchwari,
session includes the concept of oops, mainly focus on polymorphism i.e compile time polymorphism which is achieved through function overloading and operator overloading and he also make us introduce to the concept of Name mangling which is the reason of why function overloading is possible in cpp which is not possible in c where compiler rename the same name function to different name function while doing the compilation process and he also ask us a question that why should we write extern before using c librabry when using in cpp file
