Day 1
Session by: Seetharam Maddineni,
The session started with a fundamental introduction to data types in C and C++. It also provided an in-depth understanding of the extern and static keywords. Seetharam assigned us a hands-on taskâ€”to perform all possible operations on strings, which can be found in this folder!


Day 2
Session 1 by: Santhosh Malay,
This session was focused on clearing doubts regarding the training. Santhosh also shared some important credentials with us and gave insights into the training program.


Session 2 by: Lalit Manchwari,
Lalit introduced us to the structure of C programming and presented some interesting yet tricky questions on printf and scanf, making the session both challenging and engaging!


Day 3 & Day 4
Session by: Seetharam Maddineni,
These sessions covered the concepts of strings in depth. Along with resolving doubts, Seetharam introduced the concept of operators and explained the significance of bitwise operators in C++ development.


Day 5 & Day 6
Session by: Lalit Manchwari,
Lalit dived into the concept of recursion, providing an in-depth analysis of inline functions. Additionally, we explored file handling in C, covering it extensively through practical implementations.

Day 1
Session 1 by: Santhosh Malay
Santhosh covered essential concepts of C programming, including structures, unions, structure padding, pointers, and pointer arithmetic. We also delved into dynamic memory allocation using malloc, calloc, realloc, and free, understanding their real-world applications.


Session 2 by: Seetharam Maddineni
ðŸš€ OFFICIAL START OF C++ TRAINING!
Seetharam introduced us to the fundamentals of C++ programming, including its structure and the concept of classes. We explored different types of constructors, operator overloading (especially the assignment operator), and the role of destructors in memory management.
